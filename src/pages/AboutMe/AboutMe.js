        <p>Hiya my name is MayaJ0yce. I was born and raised in Utah, currently located in Bluffdale. My previous work experience has been in health care, I am now transitioning into the tech world to experience less trauma and shit (literally). My house is full of art, mostly my own, and cat hair from my two cats, Ivy and Lilith</p>
