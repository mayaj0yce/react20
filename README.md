# 20 React: React Portfolio

## Your Task

You’ll deploy this application to GitHub Pages. Follow the instructions in the Git Guide or consult the [Create React App Docs on GitHub Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) to create a build that you can deploy.

**Important**: Be sure to push your codebase to the default branch in GitHub -- NOT your built and deployed code. Ensure this happens by using the `gh-pages` branch to host the deployed application's build.

`npm run build` and then `gh-pages -d build` to start the gh pages

## User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
WHEN I load the portfolio
<!-- THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer -->

<!-- WHEN I view the header
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
WHEN I view the navigation titles
THEN I am presented with the titles  -->

About Me, 
    PHOTOS and CSS

Portfolio, 
    PHOTOS

Contact,

Resume, 

and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted 
<!-- WHEN I click on a navigation title
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted -->

<!-- WHEN I load the portfolio the first time -->
<!-- THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default -->
<!-- WHEN I am presented with the About Me section -->
<!-- THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them -->

<!-- WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section -->
<!-- THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories -->

WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
WHEN I enter text into the email address field
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address

WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies

WHEN I view the footer
THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
```


### Projects

For each project that is featured in your portfolio, include the following:

* An image of the deployed application (either a short animated GIF or screenshot)

### Design

As with the previous portfolio Challenge, remember that "good" design is subjective; however, your site should look polished. Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Use mobile-first design.

* Choose a color palette that distinguishes your site from the default Bootstrap theme and unstyled HTML sites. Refer to resources like [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) or another color scheme generator to help you create something that will stand out.

* Ensure that the font size is large enough to read and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

* Consider using animations and React component libraries. Note that this will not affect your grade, but it might impact how potential employers gauge your knowledge.

    * Application must be deployed to GitHub Pages.

### Deployment: 32%

* Application deployed at live URL.


* Application uses a color scheme other than the default Bootstrap color palette.


## Review

You are required to submit BOTH of the following for review:

* The URL of the functional, deployed application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a README that describes the project.
