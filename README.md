#React Portfolio
I was able to build a full portfolio with multiple pages and links using React.

There are links to external sites, image hrefs, front side and backend, etc

### Design
I was able to design this with bulma and had a really fun time working with a new framework. I had a few adjusting issues and snags, which is to be expected. 

There are 4 different pages within this. About me loads upon open and is the home page. The contact info has text entry boxes to add a message and send it via email. Resume has a downloadable img that is in placement of a resume. The last page is the portfolio and has 5 other projects I have done. The footer includes my github and my linkdin links which all externally deploy.
